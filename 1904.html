               The United States First Hosting

                <p>
                    The 1904 Olympic Games were some of the first to be hosted and as such they set several traditions for what the Olympic games would be.
                    This was the first Olympic to actually use the famous gold, silver, and bronze medals that are now intrinsically linked to the identity of the Olympic Games. 
                    The events of Boxing, Free Style Wrestling, Decathlon and Dumbbell Weightlifting also all made there first debut as olympic events.

                <p id="medal-text"> <!-- put in images later when all the text and other formatting is done, is that the best way to do it? probably not but it is for now. -->
               Since the 1904 Olympic Games were only the third to be held, they did not have the same notoriety or prestige that they do today. 
               In fact they were not even condsidered the main event as the United States combined the Olympics with the St. Louis festival celibrating the 100 year anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase.

                <p>
                    As such the games were both poorly funded and poorly attended with only 650 total competitors the vast majority coming from within the United States itself.
                    Another major factor in the poor attendance of these Olympic Games was the rising tension in Europe over the Russo-Japanese war.
                    This poor turn out predictably lead to the United States taking home the majority of the medals across all event and lead some of the events to only have American athletes.

                    The number of events in this Olympic were considerably smaller than more modern events as this was America's first hosting, and the Olympics itself was still in its infancy only having been around for eight years by this point. In total there were only sixteen events this year. These events include:

                The Marathon Mishaps
            </h4>
            <p id="Irish-text">
                The 1904 Olympics is likely best known for the events of the mens marathon. The 1904 marathon currently holds the world record for the slowest time for the Olympic gold medal in this event.
                The marathon was held in scortching heat on a dirst road which caused dust to be kicked up and getting in the lungs of the runners. Many of the participants ended up dropping out of the race entirely.

            <p>
                This time was set by Thomas Hicks from the United States who came in first with a time of three hours, twenty-eight minutes, and fifty-three seconds almost half an hour slower than the next slowest gold medal winner.
                Thomas Hicks finished the race practically propped up by his coaches as they had been giving him a mixture of liquor, eggs, and rat poison as a stimulant to keep Hicks going.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Thomas Hicks was not actually the first person to cross the finish. That distiction actually goes to Fredrick Lorz who crossed first after catching a ride in a car for most of the race hopping out in the final stretch finish the event. 
                When this was discovered Fredrick Lorz was disqualified and permanently banned from from competion.(However the ban was lifted as it was decided he had no intention of fraud)[<span class="endnote"><a href="https://www.olympiandatabase.com/index.php?id=159225&L=1">3</a></span>]
